            <div class="post-content">
                <p><b>DDA expected to submit land pooling policy to housing ministry by July end</b><br>Vandana Ramnani<p>
                <p>Delhi Development Authority vice-chairman Udai Pratap Singh has said the land pooling
                    policy was ready and &quot;board of hearing&quot; would be held by month-end. &quot;Hopefully by July-
                    end, the policy on land pool will be submitted to the ministry which will notify it,&quot; he told
                    reporters at a press briefing organised by the housing and urban affairs ministry.<br>Under the policy, agencies will develop infrastructure such as roads, schools, hospitals,
                    community centres, stadia on the pooled land and return a portion of the plot to the farmer
                    who can execute housing projects with the help of private builders.<br>Earlier this week, housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri had told Moneycontrol in
                    an exclusive interaction that all the work on the land pooling policy had been done.</p>
                <p>“Land pooling got mixed up with master Plan amendment. Now that the court has lifted its
                    stay we are in the process of the 15- day consultation. That 15-day consultation period will be
                    over on June 9. We will then listen to people, have meetings, people now have got time to
                    submit their suggestions. So, my answer to land pooling is… very soon.”</p>
                <p>In March, a parliamentary panel had pulled up DDA for delay in finalizing the policy, even
                    five years after it was notified.<br>Land pooling in Delhi is expected to meet the residential needs of about 95 lakh people
                    besides stimulating economic growth. It was earlier to be in place by end of April this year.<br>In December last year, the policy was simplified for speedy execution. Delhi Development
                    Authority (DDA) was to act as a facilitator and planner as against the role initially envisaged
                    for it as a part of simplification of execution of land pooling policy. The last date for
                    receiving objections and suggestions from the public was February 24.<br>Originally, land pooled under the policy was to be transferred to DDA which was to act as
                    the Developer Entity (DE) and undertake further sectoral planning and development of
                    infrastructure in the pooled land. At the December meeting it had decided to do away with
                    this requirement and said that land title will continue to be with the original land owners.<br>DDA was also asked to ensure single-window clearance mechanism for according necessary
                    approvals for speedy implementation.</p>
                <p><b>Said Ramesh Menon of Certes Realty Ltd, “The objections &amp; suggestion made by
                    experts to the Chapter 19 of the MPD 2021 needs to be addressed immediately, and the
                    process of engagement between DDA, the DE &amp; the land owners need to be formalized.
                    Wherever needed, experts from the private sector should be roped in for effectively
                    defining the process.”</b></p>
                <p>Land Pooling Policy covers the greenfield areas in five zones viz., J, K-1, L, N and P-II
                    coming under the Master Plan of Delhi-2021. To incentivize dense development for effective
                    utilization of scarce land resource in the national capital, the policy permits enhanced FAR of
                    400 as against the present 150. To promote affordable housing, an additional FAR of 15
                    percent is also allowed.<br>About 22,000 hectares of land is expected to be pooled which could meet the needs of about
                    95 lakh people. Land pooling would catalyse economic, social and civic development of the
                    national capital besides triggering substantial investments and employment generation.<br>Under the Land Pooling Policy, 60 percent of pooled land would be returned to land owners
                    after infrastructure development, if the pooled land is 20 hectares and above and 48 percent,
                    if the land pooled, is between 2 and 20 hectares. Of the 60 percent of returned land, 53
                    percent will be for residential purposes, 5 percent for city level commercial use and 2 percent
                    for public and semi-public use. In the other case, the same would be 43 percent, 3 percent and
                    2 percent, respectively.<br>Affordable houses for Economically Weaker Sections to be built under the policy shall be of
                    the size of 32-40 sq mt. Half of this housing stock shall be retained by the Developer Entity
                    to house Community Service People working for the residents/owners of the Group Housing.
                    These houses will be built at the site or at premises contiguous to the site allotted. The other
                    half of affordable houses shall be sold to DDA at the base cost of Rs 2,000 per sq ft for
                    further sale to beneficiaries.</p>
                <p><b>Experts like Ramesh Menon of Certes Realty Ltd s say that “instead of relying on the
                    in-house expertise of DDA, assistance of organizations with Management bandwidth,
                    financial understanding &amp; ground level expertise should be enlisted to fast track the
                    process of operationalization”</b><br>The main challenges before DDA are three fold – what will the actual operationalization
                    mechanism be like - the process of re-allotment (how will the 60 per cent land be returned to
                    the developer), when will spatial and services planning be initiated by DDA for the five
                    zones and finally how will it put in place infrastructure and manpower to provide the last
                    mile connect with people – will it put in place a blockchain-based technology support for
                    land pooling etc.<br><b>”DDA doesn’t have the last mile connect and infrastructure to handle the physical
                    operationalisation of land pooling. Multiple agencies like DJB, MCD etc. have to be
                    roped in, and policy interventions to be made immediately to augment the
                    infrastructure needs of these proposed smart zones. Do not repeat the mistakes of
                    Rohini and Dwarka,” says Ramesh Menon of Certes Realty.</b></p>
