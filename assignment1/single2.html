            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Not a single day passes by when this question is not discussed amongst the
                    HNIs and Investors community. Before we get to find an answer, let’s look
                    back at the changes that have happened in the industry, over the past couple
                    of years.</p>
                <p>In generic terms, Real estate Industry was associated with terms like ‘Opaque,
                    Murky, Cash, Unsafe’ etc.; which is is akin to painting the entire nature of the
                    business with one colour –<b>Black</b>. At the outset, reality is not so. <mark>A few black
                    sheep don’t make the entire barn dirty</mark> . All stakeholders in the RE industry
                    don’t behave identically.</p>
                <p>Mind you, an industry which has the potential to contribute towards <b>almost
                    1/8 th of the GDP of this nation</b> cannot be left ignored for long, both by the
                    Government as well as the Institutional &amp; HNI investors. Said that, let’s
                    examine the systemic disruptions in India, over the past 2 years, which have
                    suddenly exposed the soft underbelly of <b>a $180 Billion industry.</b></p>
                <p>&nbsp;1. Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Amendment Act</p>
                <p>&nbsp;2. Demonetization (In Nov 2016)</p>
                <p>&nbsp;3. Real Estate (Regulations &amp; development) Act 2016 (RERA)</p>
                <p>&nbsp;4. Goods &amp; Service Tax – Inclusion of RE sector</p>
                <p>&nbsp;5. REITS &amp; InvITs</p>
                <p>While the above few policy disruptions may seem like radical changes, these
                    have the potential for a more <mark> transparent &amp; predictable business eco-
                    system </mark> in the future.</p>
                <div class="text-box">
                    <b><i>“There’s no better example of the benefits of organized &amp; regulated business than
                    Mutual funds. From a market size of 2.00 lakh crore in 2001, it has grown to 24
                    lakh crores in 16 years”</i></b>~ Sandeep Parwal, MD, SPA Capital
                </div>
                <p>India is acknowledged amongst the top 10 nations who’ve improved on their
                    transparency index. Coupled with the fact that India has improved 30 places in
                    the world bank ranking of ‘Ease of doing business’.</p>
                <p>When we compare the Real estate industry in mature markets, one discerning
                    factor that stands out is the widespread participation of the investor
                    community.<mark>And investors like Conservation of capital &amp; Predictability of
                    returns.</mark>  A country as widespread as India, with a captive consumption of all
                    product categories of real estate, have very few HNI &amp; Institutional
                    participations. There are more than 15 new product categories which can
                    absorb billions of Rupees of investment; these being the non traditional
                    investment avenues of Housing, commercial office space &amp; retail spaces.</p>
                <p>As an example, let us look at just the warehousing &amp; Supply chain Industry. It
                    has the potential to transform the nation with faster connectivity, lesser
                    wastage from farm to the plate and greater efficiency of money invested. E-
                    commerce industry alone is a case in point with billions of investment across
                    multiple cities in the country.</p>
                <div class="text-box">
                    <i>“Cost of inefficiencies alone accounts for &gt;6% of the GDP in India, compared to some of the
                    more developed economies like USA, France &amp; Hong Kong. A more robust Logistics chain
                    can save billions for the economy”</i>
                </div>
                <p>Institutional players have already secured a foothold in this opportunity; said
                    that, there are ample opportunities across the country for the HNI audiences
                    to join hands with institutional experts to explore investments into Land,
                    Construction, management &amp; operations in this sector alone.</p>
                <p>Other areas wherein we are researching &amp; exploring options is specialty
                    housing, niche products &amp; participatory investments. It would be our pleasure
                    to share &amp; discuss these ideas.<mark>Vanilla products yield Vanilla returns; look
                    beyond the obvious if you seek your money to perform more efficiently.</mark></p>
                <p>The government has announced many policy initiatives like ‘Make in India’
                    which when triggered effectively, on a long term basis, would seek investment
                    in billions which were hitherto not considered by the Investors, largely owing to
                    the Opaqueness in the system.</p>
                <p>Investee mindset is changing across the nation; no longer are developers &amp;
                    builders on a high horse. <mark>It’s an investors market, not a seller’s market.</mark> A
                    more formal structure of absorption of investment is welcome. There is quaint
                    respect for the the private investor. When represented well to both, it becomes
                    a win-win situation. That’s precisely what we design &amp; execute @ SPA capital.</p>
                <p>The real estate industry has no option but to accept that it <mark>desperately needs
                    an image makeover</mark>, and there is no better way than overhaul the business
                    practices. Investor representatives dig deeper than usual, and undertake due
                    diligence to safeguard their money. Hence, not every real estate project is
                    found investment worthy. As we see the RE industry, this prolonged negative
                    phase should bring about a consolidation soon. My personal sense is that
                    there are far too many developers, who’ve grown from ‘Mom &amp; Pop stores’,
                    without any real addition to their competence of skill set. They may not make
                    the cut, and either would be taken over (I doubt, though), OR perish. The
                    associated risk was that the small investor would lose money. Some of the
                    recent legal pronouncements from the judiciary exemplifies seriousness to
                    safeguard the investment.</p>
                <p>Investee companies are realizing the importance of brand equity &amp; consumer
                    confidence. In my humble opinion, most <mark>Real estate companies should stop
                    calling themselves ‘Developers’</mark> as they aren’t investing enough into any form
                    of R&amp;D into the products they are creating. They aren’t developing anything
                    substantially path breaking, rather, merely furthering the cookie cutter
                    strategy.<mark> Shouldn’t the RE companies think more like ‘Manufacturers’?</mark> These
                    companies should only have two motives on mind – <b>Create products which
                    get produced at reasonable costs, on time without cost over-runs &amp;
                    deliver a profit to the shareholders &amp; investors.</b> Unless there is absorption
                    of the real estate by consumers who see value for money, RE companies
                    can’t have profitable operations.</p>
                <p>Let’s address the subject now.</p>
                <p>A $180 billion industry cannot do without substantial Public private
                    participation, and large pooled investments.<mark>Legislation cannot be apologetic
                    anymore, reasonable profits cannot be a bad word.</mark> We need billions in patient
                    investment, which can only be generated through the <b>predictability of policy
                    &amp; profits.</b> It is our sense that the policy makers are seized of this fact and the
                    much maligned socialist approach would be dropped.</p>
                <p>We are towards the end of the worst cycle, which has lasted for almost four
                    years. There definitely is a great opportunity to buy into deals which are
                    available at the right pricing; which would deliver intended returns provided
                    they are well researched, diligence undertaken not just on the legalities, but
                    also on the ‘Intent &amp; Ability’ of the executors.</p>
                <p>Whether you are buying, selling or monetizing your asset, it would always
                    augur well to incorporate the financial angle at the thought stage; be it
                    structuring the transaction, efficient tax planning, or re-investing into better
                    yield products.</p>
                <p>Consider this analogy from Cricket. Does the same player bat for both the
                    teams? Would he be fair if so? Wouldn’t his bias reduce his loyalty towards
                    one team while surreptitiously working against the interest of one team?
                    Likewise, you need someone to stand besides you, who bats for you; and de-
                    risks the transaction from ‘Gut-feel’. Have someone on your side, exclusively
                    playing to ensure you win. Be it cricket, or RE Investment.</p>
