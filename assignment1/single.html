            <div class="post-content">
                <p>“Whatever be the product, marketers have always sold three things - Fear, Hope &amp;
                    Greed. Real estate has been no exception.” ~ Ramesh Menon</p>
                <p><b>Are you one of the many with multiple real estate assets in your portfolio &amp; no
                    cash flow?</b></p>
                <p>Did the investor community throw caution to the wind while investing into Real as a
                    category during the past decade?</p>
                <p><b>Was the investment into a ‘Real’ asset largely led by emotions?
                    Can we be strategic about including Real estate as an asset class into our
                    portfolio and be scientific about it?</b></p>
                <p>The two most worrying problems plaguing the stakeholder in the Indian real estate
                    industry are:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;(a) Inventory Pile up</p>
                <p>&nbsp;(b) Devaluation of asset OR Non performing investment</p>
                <p>Our internal think tanks have been deliberating about the cause &amp; remedy of this
                    phenomenon over the past three years, and it’s our finding that investors haven’t
                    exactly captured three essential factors in Real estate, namely:</p>
                <p>&nbsp;(a) Tax efficient monetization</p>
                <p>&nbsp;(b) Capture value from the RE assets</p>
                <p>&nbsp;(c) Impact of new policies on overall efficiency of investments</p>
                <p>Let us admit that this prolonged slow down wasn’t exactly predicted by many
                    investors, and that the emotion led investment strategy into a few low hanging
                    segments like Residential, retail, commercial &amp; land weren’t exactly backed by a
                    strategic entry &amp; exit plan. Most times, multiple agencies have represented Real
                    estate projects/ Products to the investor community &amp; the purchased assets haven’t
                    formed a part of the ‘Managed assets &amp; wealth’</p>
                <p>While we have forever advocated that the patient capital must be deployed with a
                    clear vision into assets which deliver the forecasted results over multiple milestone,
                    backed by institutional research, our focus over the past 3 years has been to
                    <b>critically evaluate the RE portfolio</b> of individual organizations &amp; <b>work out a
                    strategic plan, including divestment, monetization &amp; overall yield from the
                    financial investment.</b> We go much beyond the traditional investment products &amp;
                    specialize in monetizing assets into segments like Warehousing, Land under Land
                    pooling, Farm houses, Data centers, educational institutions and those industries
                    wherein the respective governments seek, facilitate &amp; mentor investments by way of
                    favorable incentivized policies.</p>
                <p><b>Policies make a big impact on RE investment &amp; conclusively put to rest the
                    speculative element from investments, and de-risks both the investor &amp;
                    investee.</b> Said that, it also becomes the way forward for <b>unlocking the value from
                    non performing Real estate assets.</b></p>
                <p>To exemplify the point, let us take the example of Delhi and critically re-look at three
                    policies which have been notified, or are likely to be notified within the month of July’
                    2018.</p>
                
                <p>&nbsp;1. <b>Notification titled “Regulations for enabling the planned development of
                    Privately owned lands”</b></p>
                <p>&nbsp;~ You would recall that there has been a lot of debate on the sealing &amp;
                        unauthorized developments within Delhi, with the highest policy making
                        bodies &amp; the Supreme court involved in the same too. There are private lands
                        in Delhi, pre 1962 master plan, which hitherto were not eligible to be
                        monetized / developed by the land owning entity / individual. When read with
                        the MPD 2021 &amp; the Building bye laws now, these assets can be unlocked to
                        their full value.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;2. <b>“Notification for allowing permitted changed land use in Industrial plots
                    for non Industrial use”</b></p>
                <p>&nbsp;~ With the change in Policies, lack of investment into hard manufacturing
                    projects, environmental norms &amp; escalating costs &amp; price of Land, many
                    industrial houses &amp; owners find it unviable to manufacture in Delhi. Said that,
                    they still hold on to Real Estate Industrial assets which can be monetized for
                    non industrial use. Why not re-look at the asset portfolio dispassionately and
                    create a profitable manufacturing business.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;3. <b>Land-pooling &amp; Farmhouses in MPD 2021</b></p>
                <p>&nbsp;~ DDA recently concluded the public hearing against the 735 objections &amp;
                    suggestions towards Land pooling in Delhi. This is also significant against the
                    suggestions put forth by the Supreme court in the matter of sealing as well as
                    Urbanization of Delhi to accommodate the demand for more than a million
                    housing units to be developed.</p>
                <p>We have a specialized team of professionals who have been able to advise, assist &amp;
                    structure transactions, end-to-end, thereby facilitating monetization of non
                    performing real estate assets, as well as investments @ a predefined healthy IRR.</p>
                <p>If you ask the wish list of any investor into real estate, it would be to <b>monetize &amp;
                    own assets simultaneously; to derive tangible &amp; intangible benefits.</b></p>
                <p>If one scans through the business newspaper headlines, it is evident that the
                    importance of <b>“Monetization of Real estate assets”</b> has dawned on Governments,
                    Organizations &amp; HNIs, who are critically &amp; scientifically (not emotionally) re-
                    evaluating their RE portfolio to convert them into performing assets, and also
                    improve cash flows. Be it Air India, or Railways or any PSU, traditional
                    manufacturing organizations or Neo service entities, or even Individuals who have an
                    ‘Inventory pile-up’ on their portfolio.</p>
                <p>Culturally, Indians have been attuned to believe that monetizing RE assets is akin to
                    ‘selling family silver’, which sadly is untrue. Agreed, to sell inherited assets is an
                    emotional decision, but to re-arrange one’s assets following a more scientific
                    methodology is a strategic call. After all, <b>if you’re tracking the performance of
                    your financial assets on a periodic basis, why not real estate?</b> How often have
                    we been emotional about re-arranging our financial portfolio for better cash flow
                    management &amp; enhanced business profits?</p>
                <p>Mark Twain had famously remarked “Buy Land, they don’t make it anymore.” He said
                    Buy, possess; not hoard. Monetizing assets is about allowing your portfolio to
                    <b>perform at an optimum potential, rather than rest on a residual value.</b></p>
                <p>We have always advocated that the best time to buy is during the ‘low tide’; said that,
                    the best time to monetize is when newer opportunities emerge. And there are
                    multiple new avenues which seek the smart investor who dares to look beyond the
                    traditional avenues &amp; products in real estate.</p>
                <p>An interesting facet emanating out of an informal gathering of RE investors is that
                    <b>“there are MNC brokers, there are domestic brokers, but hardly any ‘Customer
                    centric’ consulting organizations with deep rooted understanding of both
                    finance &amp; Real estate, who work towards the success of the venture, rather
                    than the transaction.”</b></p>
