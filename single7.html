            <h1 class="post-title">WOULD DELHI CM LOSE THE MCD PLOT WITH LAND POOLING?</h1>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Strange as it may sound, the lowest denominator in the electoral hierarchy would
                    define the future of the AAP, and professional credibility of the Chief Minister of
                    Delhi.</p>
                <p>While the Delhi Govt’s stated political position is to <b>‘sauce up the sops’ at the
                    bottom of the pyramid</b>, one constituency they seem to be ignoring, at their own
                    risk, is <b>Rural Delhi.</b></p>
                <p>Contrary to the beliefs within their inner circle, the constituents of Rural Delhi are
                    extremely well informed, politically active, and unlike any other villager from other
                    parts of India. Rural Delhi is educated, financially independent, and have a malleable
                    opinion.<br>AAP would lose ground only because their lack of knowledge on the subject, and
                    <b>inability to operationalize the Land Pooling policy.</b> Here are some pointers:</p>
                <p>1. <b>Rural Delhi (or the notified zones under MPD 2021) has a population of
                    more than 4.0 million people</b><br>2. Those who grow food (read farmers in Delhi), under adverse conditions, are
                    extremely analytical of both success &amp; failure, and generally are unforgiving
                    towards those who block their progress<br>3. There is a general perception that the Land Pooling Policy has been
                    deliberately blocked by the Delhi Govt. despite the near <b>5000 acres of Gram
                    Sabha land</b> directly under the control of the Delhi Govt. revenue department
                    now.<br>4. In a much-publicized online interaction mediated by a Bollywood music
                    director, the <b>Chief minister had claimed that he would clear the file in 24
                    hours</b> if the DDA agreed to his terms.<br>5. The web of corruption by the elected representatives for unauthorized
                    development in Delhi, including all the concerned agencies is only well known;
                    <b>people pay a “nuisance tax / Lenter tax”</b> to avoid complaints and
                    enforcement of the law by the officers of the law.<br>6. Even the farmers who’ve inherited land from their forefathers aren’t spared
                    the rod using the defunct Delhi Land reforms act 1954, wherein the state send
                    notices to repossess the only asset most farmer families own, their land.
                    Their only mistake - They’re vulnerable.</p>
                <p>Sadly, the elected representatives and bureaucrats reporting to the political masters
                    <b>haven’t shown any political wisdom</b> in alienating the local farming community, and
                    focusing on the migrant population. The village populace infers that given more
                    power, the Aam Aadmi Party, and its leadership would only choke them further.</p>
                <p>Practically speaking, what’s to be done?</p>
                <p>- Since the Master plan 2021 and the development norms have already been
                    notified by the DDA and MoUD, all that the Delhi Govt. needs to do is facilitate&amp;
                    operationalize the Land Pooling, and further assist in the speedy implementation
                    of the aggregation of land from the land owners.</p>
                <p>Let’s not forget that it would be a gargantuan task, and a few detractors can derail
                    the process. <b> The Central Govt, the state Govt, the municipality &amp; the multiple
                    stakeholders including landholders &amp; investors must work hand in hand, to
                    develop Delhi.</b></p>
                <p>Or, is there a vested interest?<b>60% of the capital of a country lives in slums &amp;
                    unauthorized tenements. Is that how India’s capital’s urbanization plan is?</b></p>
                <p>Mr. Delhi CM has a great opportunity to pip the rivals by assuaging 3.5 million
                    affected people in Rural Delhi that they intend to actualize the Land Pooling Policy,
                    and that AAP can be trusted. That might be adhesive enough to plug the leaks in a
                    sinking ship.</p>
                <p><b>Else, mind you, they can get together &amp; align their interests, voices &amp; votes
                    too.</b></p>
